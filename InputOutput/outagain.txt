In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.

I think this is a pretty cool program
though it is noted that: "CopyBytes seems
like a normal program, but it actually represents
a kind of low-level I/O that you should avoid. Since
xanadu.txt contains character data, the best
approach is to use character streams, as discussed
in the next section. There are also streams for more
complicated data types. Byte streams should only be used
for the most primitive I/O."
